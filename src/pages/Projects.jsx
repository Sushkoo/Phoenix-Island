        <h1 className="font-bold text-blue-500">Chapter 1: The Great House</h1>

        <p>The sun was setting over the flying island, casting a warm golden glow on the lush green landscape. The newest guardian, a mythical young bird, with a flaming red body and a long tail, soared gracefully through the sky.  As the sun dipped below the horizon, the phoenix landed on the roof of the great house in the center of the island.
        The great house was a magnificent structure, with a large open room in the center and smaller rooms branching off from it. The phoenix entered the main room and found a table with a map of the island. The map was covered in intricate drawings of the island's various landmarks, including the great house, the well, the forest of foxes, and the carrot garden.

        <h1 className="font-bold text-blue-500">Chapter 2: The Well</h1>
        
        <p>
        The phoenix left the great house and flew towards the well. The well was quiet mysterious with the fog in the bottom. The phoenix saw some little glowing thing at the bottom of the well so it lowered down into the well and found a runestone and a small room at the bottom.
        Inside the room, there was a small pool of water. The phoenix dipped its beak into the water and drank thirstily. As it drank, it noticed a small door at the back of the room. The phoenix opened the door and found a hidden passage leading to a portal which worked with the rune. As the phoenix put the rune to it's place, the portal opened and everything faded.

        <h1 className="font-bold text-blue-500">Chapter 3: The Forest of Foxes</h1>
        
        <p>
        As the phoenix opened it's eyes, it found itself in a forest filled with playful creatures, each with a unique color and pattern.
        A nine tailed fox, with a bright red body and a bushy tails, approached the phoenix. "Hey," it said, "I know what you are looking for, I could help you... Come with me..."
        The phoenix followed the fox through the forest and met a group of foxes who challenged them a game of their choice. The phoenix and the fox won a game of tag funfact they cheated.
        </p>
        <br />
        
        <h1 className="font-bold text-blue-500">Chapter 4: The Carrot Garden</h1>
        
        <p>
        The phoenix and the fox finally reached the carrot garden. The garden was filled with rows of huge carrots, each with a different color and size. The phoenix marveled at the beauty of the garden and thanked the fox for its help. It found it's parents feathers, and their note. "One day, we will return but for now, just protect everything what's around you". As the sun began to rise, the phoenix bid farewell to the mysterious creature and flew back to the great house. The phoenix then returned to its perch on the roof, ready to watch over the flying island and its inhabitants for another day.
        And so, the phoenix continued to protect the flying island, its inhabitants, and the magical landmarks that made it so special.
